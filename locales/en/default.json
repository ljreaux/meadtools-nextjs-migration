{"about":{"label":"About","paragraphOne":" MeadTools came to me as an idea to help my mead making community      while simultaneously kickstarting a new career in software      development. There are several other tools to assist in mead making,      but most are confusing to beginners, or, in my opinion incomplete.      My hope is that MeadTools solves these issues.","paragraphThree":"MeadTools is completely open source under a MIT license, so if you      want to check out the code, please have a look over on GitHub. If      you use any of the code for anything fun, I just ask that you share      it with me and the rest of the mead making community.","paragraphTwo":"Below I have listed all of the resources that I used in the creation      of MeadTools as well as additional mead making resources. I can’t      thank my personal mead community enough for making this project      possible. I can be found on discord in the Doin’ the Most and Man      Made Mead Mazer servers. My user name is larry_r. There is also a      brand new MeadTools discord.

Follow these links for additional information ","linkTexts":["DtM Video, ","Scott Labs Article, ","Chef's Article."]},"brix":"Brix measures the amount of dissolved solids in solution. 1g of sucrose in 100ml of water is 1 Brix, so it is roughly the same as percent sugar. You can measure brix with a refractometer, calculate it by nutrition facts, or convert your SG to brix over on ExtraCalc to use custom sugar percentages in this calculator. ","campden":"Campden tablets vary quite a bit in the amount of free SO2 that they provide MeadTools assumes that one campden tablet provides 75PPM of free SO2.","delleUnits":"Delle units are a measure of microbial stability. The higher the number, the more likely the brew is stable without the need for additional additives or stabilization methods. Delle units are calculated based on the amount of residual sugar and the ABV of the brew. 73 delle units is considered stable by most, but the actual number varies. Alcohol tolerance is NOT considered in delle stability.

If your yeast is not on the list, and you do not know its nitrogen requirement, enter it as Other: Other Medium N Yeast. This field is also editable if you want to use a yeast at a different requirement level than typical.","numberOfAdditions":"Staggered nutrient additions are useful in preventing temperature spikes during fermentation that can stress the yeast. Four nutrient additions is probably the most common regimen, but I personally use three additions or a single addition in most cases.","nutrientSg":"This is the difference in gravity, taking FG into account. For example, if your OG is listed as 1.100 and your FG is 1.010, this field will read 1.090. This can field can be edited.","offsetPpm":"Some musts contain some YAN by themselves.

It is really up to you which nutrients or combinations you decide to use, but certain combos are better for certain situations. Read more about nutrients and schedules ","remainingYan":"If your remaining YAN is more than 0, you should consider adjusting the max g/L field. Keep in mind you should probably keep your amount of DAP under .96g/L for risk of off-flavors. Also the TTB limit on Fermaid K is .5g/L due to the limit on thiamine. This is not a concern for homebrewers.","stabilizers":"Potassium sorbate (k-sorb) AND potassium metabisulfite (k-meta) are both needed to prevent refermentation. They cannot be reliably used to STOP fermentation in most cases. Amounts of k-meta needed for stabilizing are based on your pH. MeadTools assumes 50ppm if you choose not to take a pH reading. K-sorb amount is based on your ABV. It is not effective above around 16%. More info can be found ","totalSecondary":"This is the estimated volume of the entire batch including secondary fermentables.
