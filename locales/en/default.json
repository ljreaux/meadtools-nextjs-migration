{"about":{"label":"About","paragraphOne":" MeadTools came to me as an idea to help my mead making community      while simultaneously kickstarting a new career in software      development. There are several other tools to assist in mead making,      but most are confusing to beginners, or, in my opinion incomplete.      My hope is that MeadTools solves these issues.","paragraphThree":"MeadTools is completely open source under a MIT license, so if you      want to check out the code, please have a look over on GitHub. If      you use any of the code for anything fun, I just ask that you share      it with me and the rest of the mead making community.","paragraphTwo":"Below I have listed all of the resources that I used in the creation      of MeadTools as well as additional mead making resources. I can’t      thank my personal mead community enough for making this project      possible. I can be found on discord in the Doin’ the Most and Man      Made Mead Mazer servers. My user name is larry_r. There is also a      brand new MeadTools discord.

If your yeast is not on the list, and you do not know its nitrogen requirement, enter it as Other: Other Medium N Yeast. This field is also editable if you want to use a yeast at a different requirement level than typical.","numberOfAdditions":"Staggered nutrient additions are useful in preventing temperature spikes during fermentation that can stress the yeast. Four nutrient additions is probably the most common regimen, but I personally use three additions or a single addition in most cases.","nutrientSg":"This is the difference in gravity, taking FG into account. For example, if your OG is listed as 1.100 and your FG is 1.010, this field will read 1.090. This can field can be edited.","offsetPpm":"Some musts contain some YAN by themselves. This calculator automatically assumes 25ppm per pound of fruit per gallon, but if you would like to change the offset the field is editable.","ogSeriousWarning":"This brew will likely finish fermenting above 1.000 even with step feeding and proper nutrition. If your OG is above 1.170, fermentation may trouble starting.","ogWarning":"Consider step feeding honey at this gravity.","oneThird":"When 1/3 of the sugars in the must have been consumed. This number is often used for the timing of the final nutrient addition.","preferredSchedule":"This calculator allows you to enter any combination of Fermaid O, K, and DAP. It is really up to you which nutrients or combinations you decide to use, but certain combos are better for certain situations. Read more about nutrients and schedules ","remainingYan":"If your remaining YAN is more than 0, you should consider adjusting the max g/L field. Keep in mind you should probably keep your amount of DAP under .96g/L for risk of off-flavors. Also the TTB limit on Fermaid K is .5g/L due to the limit on thiamine. This is not a concern for homebrewers.","stabilizers":"Potassium sorbate (k-sorb) AND potassium metabisulfite (k-meta) are both needed to prevent refermentation. They cannot be reliably used to STOP fermentation in most cases. Amounts of k-meta needed for stabilizing are based on your pH. MeadTools assumes 50ppm if you choose not to take a pH reading. K-sorb amount is based on your ABV. It is not effective above around 16%. More info can be found ","totalSecondary":"This is the estimated volume of the entire batch including secondary fermentables. This calculator assumes that anything you listed above as a secondary ingredient will not be fermented on. ","totalVolume":"This total volume is an estimate of only the fermentables in solution during primary fermentation, your actual volume WILL be higher if using high fruit loads.","volumeLines":"The first two lines only contain liquid ingredients, all lines on this calculator can be added by either volume or weight.","yan":"Yeast Assimilable Nitrogen (YAN) is the amount of nitrogen needed by your yeast to have a healthy fermentation. Your target YAN is determined by your initial gravity and your yeast's nitrogen requirements.","yeastAmount":"The yeast amount in this calculator is based on the gravity reading and total volume.
